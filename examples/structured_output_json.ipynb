    "# **Meeting Scheduling with Structured JSON Output and Inflection AI**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an approach to **meeting scheduling** using **structured prompting** and **JSON-based extraction**. The goal is to parse user requests and generate structured meeting details for efficient scheduling automation. By leveraging **instruction-based prompting**, this method enhances **accuracy** and ensures **consistent, machine-readable outputs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Utilizes **structured prompting** to extract key meeting details from user input.\n",
    "- Employs a **guiding system instruction prompt** to maintain consistency.\n",
    "- The model performs the following tasks:\n",
    "  - Extracts **meeting duration**, **date**, **participants**, **topic**, and **additional details** from free-text inputs.\n",
    "  - Handles **relative date references** (e.g., \"next Friday\") with **dynamic date calculations**.\n",
    "  - Outputs results in **JSON format** for seamless integration with scheduling systems.\n",
    "  - Uses a **task-specific inference model** optimized for structured information extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach enables **automated meeting scheduling** by transforming unstructured text into actionable data."

    "    2. Your job is to extract the parts of the request that are relevant to scheduling the meeting.\n",
    "    3. Use Local Date: as a reference only when a specific date is not provided in the user's request.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Valid Parts\n",
    "    - Time Duration: The duration of the meeting in minutes.\n",
    "    - Date: The date of the meeting.\n",

    "    - Meeting Topic: The main topic or subject of the meeting.\n",
    "    - Additional Details: Any additional context or details mentioned.\n",
