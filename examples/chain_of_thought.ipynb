    "# **Intent Recognition for Service Routing using Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Inflection AI API**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement **intent recognition** for a **Service Router** using **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning**. The goal is to classify user intents and generate structured responses that optimize service routing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Utilizes **Chain-of-Thought prompting** to enhance intent classification and decision-making.\n",
    "- Employs a **guiding instruction prompt** for consistent and structured output.\n",
    "- The model performs the following tasks:\n",
    "  - Extracts **user intent** by identifying the appropriate **service category** based on query and intent history.\n",
    "  - Provides a **reasoning trace** before making a classification.\n",
    "  - Outputs results in **XML format** for downstream automation.\n",
    "  - Utilizes the **`inflection_3_productivity` model**, optimized for task-specific classification like intent recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging **structured prompting and reasoning**, this approach improves **accuracy** and ensures **efficient, interpretable routing**. The **XML output** format enables seamless integration with automation pipelines."
