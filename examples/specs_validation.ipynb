    "\n",
    "- Implements **AI-based validation** for structured specifications.\n",
    "- Utilizes a **prompting-based model** to analyze document content.\n",
    "- The model performs the following tasks:\n",
    "  - Extracts **key compliance criteria** from specification documents.\n",
    "  - Identifies **potential inconsistencies and errors**.\n",
    "  - Outputs structured validation reports for **further review**.\n",
    "- Uses a **state-of-the-art Inflection AI LLM** optimized for analysis and validation."

    "- Coverage: Ensure that all key functionalities described in the specifications are tested.\n",
    "- Edge Cases: Identify and include edge cases, boundary values, and potential failure scenarios.\n",
    "- Assertions: Use clear and meaningful assertions to verify expected behavior.\n",
    "- Mocking & Fixtures: If applicable, use mocking (e.g., `unittest.mock`) and test fixtures to isolate test dependencies.\n",
