    "# **Structured Output Generation using XML Formatting**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to generate **structured output** in **XML format** for downstream processing and automation workflows. It ensures that generated responses are **machine-readable, structured, and consistent**, improving **interoperability** with external systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implements **structured response generation** using **XML format**.\n",
    "- Enhances **data organization and automation** by ensuring consistent output formatting.\n",
    "- The notebook workflow includes:\n",
    "  - Extracting **key information** from user input.\n",
    "  - Structuring the extracted data into a **well-defined XML format**.\n",
    "  - Ensuring **validity** and **consistency** of XML output for seamless integration.\n",
    "- Provides an **example-driven approach** to XML generation, demonstrating step-by-step output formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structured approach enables better **data exchange**, **automation**, and **interoperability** in service-oriented architectures.\n"

    "    1. You will be given a request from a user to schedule a meeting.\n",
    "    2. Your job is to extract the parts of the request that are relevant to scheduling the meeting.\n",
    "    3. Use Local Date: as a reference only when a specific date is not provided in the user's request.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Valid Parts\n",
    "    - Time Duration: The duration of the meeting in minutes.\n",
    "    - Date: The date of the meeting.\n",
