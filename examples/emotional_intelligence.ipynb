    "# **Emotional Intelligence in Social Media Interactions using AI-driven Response Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement **emotionally intelligent response generation** for **social media interactions**. The goal is to classify message tones and generate appropriate responses that align with the emotional context of the conversation. By leveraging **context-aware prompting and structured reasoning**, this approach enhances **engagement, user experience, and sentiment alignment** in automated responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Utilizes **emotion classification** to adapt responses based on message tone and platform context.\n",
    "- Employs a **structured reasoning framework** for generating empathetic and contextually appropriate replies.\n",
    "- The model performs the following tasks:\n",
    "  - **Classifies emotional tone** of incoming messages across different social media platforms.\n",
    "  - **Adjusts response style** based on detected sentiment and conversation flow.\n",
    "  - Generates **structured, adaptive replies** that enhance engagement and mitigate negative interactions.\n",
    "  - Ensures responses align with **platform-specific norms and user expectations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach improves **customer experience**, minimizes misinterpretations, and enhances brand communication consistency across social media channels.\n"
